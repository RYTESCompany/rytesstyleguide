# Branding

RYTES Company is our primary brand and is the name that we present to our clients. While there are many other companies that contribute to our product, RYTES Company is front and center. When clients interact with our products, they are expecting to interact with RYTES Company, so our titles, branding, logos, and verbiage should all reflect that.

### Company name

*Would be good to know where the name of the company comes from. Is the word "Company" redundant? Does RYTES stand for something?*

Always uppercase RYTES. Always capitalize Company. Always a space between the words. Do not refer to it as "The RYTES Company", just "RYTES Company"

```
✔️ RYTES Company
❌ Rytes Company
❌ RYTESCompany
❌ rytes company
❌ The RYTES Company
```

### Company slogan

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Effective Regulatory Navigation</span> should never be in quotes. 

Should always be in a smaller font size than the company name. 

Should always be all caps - small caps where available. 

There should be no period after the slogan.

```
✔️ EFFECTIVE REGULATORY NAVIGATION
❌ EFFECTIVE REGULATORY NAVIGATION.
❌ "EFFECTIVE REGULATORY NAVIGATION"
❌ Effective regulatory navigation
❌ Effective Regulatory Navigation
```

*Alternative slogan suggestions:*

- Navigating regulation the RYTES way
- The RYTE way to navigate regulations
- Know your RYTES
- Committed to your success

### Product names

Always uppercase RYTES, and always present the product name as one word. This applies to RYTESite and RYTESInsights. 

No longer refer to "the portal", or "the internal site", or "the client portal". From now on, only use the branded terms "RYTESite" for the client-facing portal, and "RYTESInsight" for the internal dashboard.

*Since RYTESite is external, and RYTESInsights is internal, should it be stylized as RYTESInsite?*

## Logo

Never stack the icon and the type. They should always be horizontal. The icon can be used without the type and vice versa. If the type is used without the icon, use text instead of an image.

#### ✔️ Standalone Icon

#### ❌ Stacked Icon and Text

*Flag icon to be changed to something that we can actually trademark - current iteration is too close to the American Flag?*
