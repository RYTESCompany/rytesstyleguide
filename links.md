# Links and actions

Never use "Click here" or "Tap here" as the text for an action. This is ambiguous, device-specific, and does not indicate what will happen when the button is used.

### Buttons
For buttons, use the action the button will take- "View Facility", "Sign Up", "Delete Record", "Create Case". If screen space is at a premium, just the verb will do- "View", "Register", "Delete", "Create".

### Links
When an action/verb is not appropriate, use a link instead of a button, with the text representing the name of the target- "Foot Locker", "Federal Guidelines", or "Dashboard".
