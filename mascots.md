# Mascots

*Open Questions- When should we use the mascot? Should we have multiple mascots? Does it dilute the messaging/impact of the character(s)? Where are they most appropriate? Where does it feel like the use of a character lessens the impact of a message?*

### D-Free

<img src="./images/dfree-point-up.gif" style="width: 200px; float: left" /> The name D-Free should always be stylized as D-Free. Always capitalize the D and the F, and always put a dash between them.

### F-Tag
