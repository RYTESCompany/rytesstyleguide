# Typography

We should avoid using italics and bold unless absolutely necessary or for specific use cases like titles of media or attributions. Instead of using bold or italics to highlight the important information, consider rephrasing to be more concise and exclude superflous language.

## Headings and titles

Headings and titles should always use sentence case. Capitalize the first word, everything following that is not a proper noun should be lowercase.

Use proper heading hierarchy for headings and titles- h3 should always follow h2, after h1, etc.

Do not use punctuation in headings and titles.

## Dates and times

Use the "Month, Day, Year" format when writing dates - Jan 10, 1990. This is preferable to 1/10/2023 - that would be October 1st in the UK, but January 10th in the US. Avoid ambiguity- write out the name of the month. Abbreviation is fine. You may include the name of the day of the week at the beginning of the date if you'd like.

Be precise when writing a time. Noon and Midnight are OK.

Include the timezone when communicating a time. This can take the form of "your local time" - for example, "Let's schedule the meeting for 3pm Mountain time". 

## Phone numbers

Type phone numbers in the following format: (888) 555-0199

If a phone number uses an extension: (888) 555-0198 ext. 567

## Ordered List

When using nested ordered list: Numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, lowercase roman numerals, uppercase roman numerals. In HTML, you can define the root list (`<ol>` tag) as follows:
`<ol type="1|a|A|i|I"> ... </ol>`

## Font

Text that will primarily be shown on screens should always be sans-serif, and Arial is the recommended font.

Always follow guidelines for specific cases. For example, if a courtroom has a preferred style, use that over the RYTES Company's style.
