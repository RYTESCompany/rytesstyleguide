# Typography

We should avoid using italics and bold unless absolutely necessary or for specific use cases like titles of media or quotes. Instead of using bold or italics to highlight the important information, consider rephrasing to be more concise and exclude superflous language. See Voice->Simple.

## Font

Text on the web should always be sans-serif (without pen strokes), because sans-serif fonts are more readable on screens. The font we use should also be available by default on Windows and Mac platforms, so we don't need to embed the font files, wait for the user to download, etc. This will allow our communication to maintain a consistent look no matter who views it on any device.

All RYTES Company communication should use the Arial font for body copy.

Titles for pages/sections and headings should always be bolded.
