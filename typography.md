# Typography

We should avoid using italics and bold unless absolutely necessary or for specific use cases like titles of media or attributions. Instead of using bold or italics to highlight the important information, consider rephrasing to be more concise and exclude superflous language.

## Headings and titles

Headings and titles should always use sentence case.

Use proper heading hierarchy for headings and titles- h3 should always follow h2, after h1, etc.

Do not use punctuation in headings and titles

## Dates and times

Always use the "Mon, Day, Year" format when writing dates - Jan 10, 1990. This is preferable to 1/10/2023 - that would be October 1st in the UK, but January 10th in the US. Avoid ambiguity- write out the name of the month. Abbreviation is fine. 

Always be precise when writing a time. Noon and Midnight are OK.

Always include the timezone when communicating a time. This can take the form of "your local time" - for example, "Let's schedule the meeting for 3pm your local time". 

## Phone numbers

Always type phone numbers in the following format: (888) 555-0199

If a phone number uses an extension, add a comma and type out the word extension for clarity: (888) 555-0198, extension 567

## Font

Text on the web should always be sans-serif (without pen strokes), because sans-serif fonts are more readable on screens. The font we use should also be available by default on Windows and Mac platforms, so we don't need to embed the font files, wait for the user to download, etc. This will allow our communication to maintain a consistent look no matter who views it on any device.

All RYTES Company communication should use the Arial font for body copy.
