# Voice
RYTES Company's organizational voice can be described as Competent and Actionable. Our clients rely on us, so we need to be correct and clear about what to do. 

When speaking to clients, remember that we are consultants. Do not use words like can, may, or shall. Instead, use language like "we recommend", or "I advise". 

Where possible, try to use a consistent tense. Avoid switching between future and present unless it's required by the subject. For example- "We advise cleaning the kitchen more thoroughly".
