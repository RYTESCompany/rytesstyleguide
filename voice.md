# Voice
RYTES Company's organizational voice can be described as Authoritative, Simple, and Human. We want to be relatable, knowledgeable, and referencable when we are communicating with our clients. Since clients might rely on our words in a court of law, we need to get things right. We also need to be clear and specific when we say things. We want to avoid any ambiguous statements, and we want clients to feel as if we've got their back. We need to translate obtuse legalese into everyday English, but without losing meaning in the process.

## Authoritative
Authoritative voice means we know what we're talking about. We are experts on the subject and we are providing accurate information. Authoritative does not mean condescending or aloof - we are here to help, not to talk down to our clients, residents, or their families.

## Simple
Simple voice means we are sending a message that everyone can understand, whether they are a doctor, a lawyer, or a resident. Simple does not mean juvenile, boring, or vague- we are communicating complex ideas in a way that everyone gets.

## Human
Human voice means that while we are experts, we are people too, and understand what it's like to be in this situation. We are working to find a solution that works for everyone involved, and are here to make sure everyone feels heard.

### Client-facing Voice
When speaking to clients, we want to emphasize the Authoritative and Simple parts of our brand's Voice. We can be a little less human when speaking to clients, because it's all business here.

### Resident-facing Voice
When speaking to residents or their loved ones, we want to emphasize the Simple and Human parts of our brand's Voice. When dealing with complaints from real people, more than anything we just want to be good listeners.
