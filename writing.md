# Writing style

Use a single space after a period, and no space before a period.

Use the [Serial Comma](https://www.merriam-webster.com/video/serial-comma) where applicable. 

Use a colon instead of dashes to separate content within a list.

- ✔️ Good example: using a colon
- ❌ Bad example- using a dash instead.
- ✔️ Updated feature: colors are now standardized (good)
- ❌ Removed functionality- case creation for internal users (bad)

Use first person when making recommendations- "We suggest that you follow the instructions of the local police department."

Use active voice: make clear who's performing the action.

Use standard American spelling and punctuation.

Put conditions before instructions, not after.

Use the word "and" instead of an ampersand (&).

Avoid using abbreviations that are not widely known. If abbreviations are necessary, define the abbreviation at the top of the document, and continue to use the abbreviation consistently throughout the rest of the text. Feel free to use abbreviations in casual, conversational situations.
