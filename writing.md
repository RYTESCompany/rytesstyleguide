# Writing Style

Use a single space after a period, and no space before a period.

Use the Serial/Oxford Comma where applicable. 

Use second person: "you" rather than "we."

Use active voice: make clear who's performing the action.

Use standard American spelling and punctuation.

Put conditions before instructions, not after.

Use the word "and" instead of an ampersand (&).

Use a colons instead of dashes to separate content within a list.
